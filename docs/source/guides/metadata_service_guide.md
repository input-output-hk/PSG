# The Metadata Service API

This document describes using the service as an API. Working knowledge of gRpc is assumed.

## Service API Protobuf

This is a partial listing of the MetadataService (v0.2)
```
service MetadataService {
   rpc SubmitMetadata(SubmitMetadataRequest) returns (stream SubmitMetadataResponse);
   rpc ListMetadata(ListMetadataRequest) returns (stream ListMetadataResponse);
}

message SubmitMetadataRequest {
  oneof options {
    string metadata = 1;
    string tx_id = 2; //For restarts, will start polling
  }
  int32 until_depth = 3;
  iog.psg.service.common.CredentialsMessage credentials = 4;
}

message SubmitMetadataResponse {
  oneof result {
    string problem = 1;
    TxStatus tx_status = 2;
  }
}
```

There are two functions, one for submitting metadata or checking on an already submitted metadata transaction and a second listing function.

Both methods provide a *stream* of responses.

### Submit Metadata

To submit metadata the caller provides 

  - the depth 
    
This is the number of blocks the caller wants the metadata transaction buried under. 
If the caller specifies a depth of 1 block there is always the chance the blockchain will reorganise itself and remove the transaction, 
a depth of 100 means that possibility is vanishingly small, but the call will take longer. 

  - the credentials

These are the credentials generated by the PSG Services web application after the user has created a "log in" and paid for use of the services.

**Note**: - valid credentials are not necessary when using the testnet 
  - the metadata 

Provide the metadata as a string in JSON format, but conforming to the schema described
[here](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/postTransactionFee)

  - OR the transaction id

The first result in the stream of results returned by the call will contain the transaction id (`tx_id`). In the case where the call is 
interrupted  it can be restarted by calling "SubmitMetadata" again but providing the transaction id instead of the metadata. 

The result will be a stream of responses; these responses are checked for status, first to make sure the request has a state 'IN_LEDGER'
and finally, to indicate the transaction has been 'buried' under the requisite number of blocks.

In the case of a problem, that problem is described in the `problem` field of the response.`


### List Metadata

List all metadata transactions between the dates given.  

**Note**: The list contains transactions from **all** users. In order to get transactions for a particular user - you need to filter a list by `metadata` or `transactionId`. 

**Note**: the dates are optional and when not provided, all metadata transactions are returned.

**Note**: if a transaction has no metadata, it will not be listed by this call.

**Note**: on the very rare occasions where the internal service configuration drastically changes transactions associated with a clientId may not be returned. 
Client applications that have a critical long term dependency on remembering the ids of the transactions they posted are advised to make an independent record of the transaction id.
